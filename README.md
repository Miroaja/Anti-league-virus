# Anti-league-virus
A very simple virus I made as a challenge. Deletes league of legends and keeps you from re-installing it.

To build the file you must add a visual studio resource script into the "cringe league" project pointing at "the bomb" executable, the resource type should be "Executable".
Use the "add -> add resource -> import" function to do this in visual studio.
